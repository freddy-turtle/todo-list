# Todo List

This is an example todo-list feature with drag & drop feature implemented with [React-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#readme). This Library is no longer maintained but compatibility is up to date, so if you are interested, take a look in this project.

Styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## organisation of code

This todo list is made of five principles components

itemList.jsx // contains all the items of the todo list
Add.jsx // add a new item in the list
Delete.jsx // delete action
Edit.jsx // Edit an item of the list
Input.jsx // The input element to edit an item

the itemList component is the root of the todo List and is contained in the single page of the todo list.
